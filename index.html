    <h2>Why I love to code</h2>
    <p>
      Coding for me is a perfect mix of creativity and science. Creativity in the sense of using imagination and style, but also
      in the literal sense of making something, and the great satisfaction that comes with that. I have always loved studying
      sciences and computer science has proven no different! Programming can be scientific and mathematical and processes
      in tech are often highly methodological, which really appeals to me.
      <br>
      <br> From what I have experienced, the tech community has been welcoming, friendly, and full of people eager to learn and
      help others learn too. I hope to contribute to this community as a student and teacher in years to come!

  <div id="about_me" class="about-me">
    <img class="side_bird" src="img/bigBird.png" alt="blue origami bird" />
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Aside from my development career, I love attending meet ups and tech events in London and working on personal projects. Outside
      tech, I enjoy running, yoga, cooking and crafts (including origami).

    </p>
    <p>
      Before teaching myself to code, I ran the finances for a start-up creative agency and recruitment company. Frustrated by
      my inability to create the tools I wanted, I took an online course in JavaScript and have hardly looked back since.
