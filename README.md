## Hey!

This is my application website for the **Founders and Coders** Programme in London. 
If you don't know what that is, check out their website [here](https://foundersandcoders.com/)!

If you want to see more JavaScript from me, check out my calculator project [here](https://github.com/developess/calculator).

I'm proud to say I learnt to code and completed this project with no help other than 
the knowledge google, treehouse and freeCodeCamp provided me. 

Thanks for reading!
