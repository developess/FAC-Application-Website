## About this Project

This was my final website submission for my application to Founders & Coders. This was the first time I drew a complete design before coding a website and it really helped speed up the process. I also used the opportunity to learn the basics of Sketch, where I created custom SVG images and icons for this site. 

The site was worked on in the first week of the course (we performed accessibility audits and implemented improvements), and I added a couple of retouches towards the end of the course.

The biggest learning point for me in building the site was animations and transitions, which was something I wanted to learn and try out (perhaps I went a little overboard there?!). 

The site is pure HTML & CSS, so if you want to see a little more JavaScript from me, check out my noughts and crosses project [here](https://github.com/developess/Noughts-and-Crosses).
